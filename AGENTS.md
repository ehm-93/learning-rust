Welcome to Untitled Game!

This is a hobby project I'm mostly working on just to learn Rust, but 
I'm also hoping it will evolve into a fun game over time. I'm using 
[Bevy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bevyengine/bevy/refs/heads/main/README.md) and
[Repier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier/refs/heads/master/README.md) 
as our ECS and physics engines, respectively.

See docs/vision.md for a high level vision statement which will give
you an understanding of the gameplay loop.

You should review the git commit history to get context on the current
state of the project, just the last few commits should be enough. You
can find specifications for development iterations at `./docs/*/*` such
as `./docs/phase-01/phase-01.md`.

The primary source code is available at `./untitled`. You may see other 
workspaces such as `./sanity` or `./shadowcast`, these are just little
demo apps for learning Rust or game development.
