# Stalkerlike

Hobby game project for learning Rust and Bevy. Currently building a 3D level editor.

## Running

```bash
# Editor (what exists now)
cargo run -- --editor

# Game mode (basic prototype)
cargo run
```

## What Works

**Editor Mode**
- Free-fly camera
- Place primitives (cube, sphere, plane, etc.)
- Transform gizmos (move, rotate, scale)
- Grid snapping
- Save/load scenes to YAML

**Game Mode**
- First-person controller
- Basic menus
- Save/load system

## Controls

**Editor**: WASD/QE to fly, click to select, F to cycle gizmo modes, G for grid snap, Ctrl+S to save

**Game**: WASD to move, F for flashlight, ESC for menu
