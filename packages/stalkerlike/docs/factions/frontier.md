# Frontier Faction

## Overview
**Population**: 1,800 (36% of colony - largest single group)  
**Territory**: Levels 2-6km (contested zones)  
**Power**: 30 MW (controlled by three Voltaic Lords)  
**Structure**: Dozens of competing settlements and crews  
**Average Lifespan**: 8 months

## History

### Formation (Years 13-15)
Born from refugees of D+13. Those who fled both Corporate and Union violence, seeking independence in the abandoned zones between.

### Generational Drift
- 1st generation: Refugees with memories of unified colony
- 2nd generation: Raised in conflict, know only division
- 3rd-4th generation: Frontier-born, no loyalty to either faction
- Current: Mostly 3rd-4th generation, Frontier is their identity

### The Proxy Wars (Years 55-165)
Became the battleground for Corporate-Union conflict. Both factions actively prevent Frontier unity while using them as proxy forces.

## Major Power Structures

### Voltaic Lords (3 groups, ~600 people)
**Power**: Control the three captured voltaic banks  
**Politics**: Play Corporate and Union against each other  
**Economy**: Sell power to smaller contractors  
**Status**: Kingmakers in the proxy war  
**Internal**: Compete with each other, prevent unified Frontier

### Pit Boss Territories (~400 people)
**Structure**: Traditional company towns  
**Power**: RTG-powered (5-10 MW each)  
**Alignment**: Corporate-licensed, sell C-7  
**Economy**: Scrip system, company stores  
**Delusion**: Think they're independent, actually Corporate clients

### Independent Crews (~600 people)
**Size**: 10-20 person operations  
**Equipment**: Cobbled-together, scavenged  
**Economy**: Sell to highest bidder  
**Mortality**: Highest death rate, most desperate  
**Role**: Cannon fodder in proxy conflicts

### Scav Kingdoms (~200 people)
**Control**: Access to ruins and collapsed sectors  
**Trade**: Salvage Old Company equipment  
**Alignment**: Neutral (both factions need them)  
**Motto**: "Profit from the dead"

## The Whisper Cults (~100 scattered)

### The Stone Speakers (~30 people)
- Hear "harmonics" in C-7 deposits
- Sabotage mining operations
- Sometimes warn of real dangers
- Sometimes lead people to death

### The Reapers (~20 people)
- Hear commands to "help transformation"
- Forcibly expose people to C-7
- Drag victims to Dissolution Sites
- Serial killers or prophets?

### The Silent (~30 people)
- Hear constant screaming
- Wander in fugue states
- Unpredictable violence
- Sometimes accurate prophecies

### The Chorus (~20 people)
- Hear "many voices as one"
- Build shrines at Dissolution Sites
- Lead people to transformation
- Recruit desperate workers

## Political Alignments

### Corporate-Aligned (~500)
- Pit Bosses and some Voltaic Lords
- Receive Corporate supplies and security
- "Better Corporate's order than Union's chaos"

### Union-Aligned (~400)
- Defectors and sympathizers
- Receive Union food and expertise
- "Union lives better, Corporate are fascists"

### True Independents (~700)
- Want neither faction's control
- Dream of unified Frontier
- Too divided to organize effectively

### Opportunists (~200)
- Black marketeers and smugglers
- Profit from continued conflict
- Actively oppose unity (bad for business)

## Why They Can't Unite

### Economic Competition
- Voltaic Lords won't share power
- Pit Bosses tied to Corporate contracts
- Crews compete for same resources
- Scavengers need conflict to profit

### Active Sabotage
- Corporate and Union both prevent unity
- Assassinate potential unifiers
- Fund opposing factions
- Spread propaganda and mistrust

### Whisper Cult Chaos
- Constant sabotage and violence
- Unpredictable attacks
- Create atmosphere of paranoia
- ~100 people terrorizing 1,800

### Geographic Fragmentation
- Spread across 4km of depth
- Dozens of isolated settlements
- No unified communication
- Travel between zones dangerous

## Daily Reality

### Mining Operations
- High C-7 exposure without protection
- Makeshift equipment, frequent failures
- Constant threat of Touched encounters
- Cult sabotage disrupts operations

### Survival Economics
- Pay for power from Voltaic Lords
- Sell C-7 to highest bidder
- Barter for food and supplies
- Black market for everything else

### Social Structure
- No central authority or law
- Settlement justice varies wildly
- Strong prey on weak
- Cults operate freely

## Relationships

### With Corporate
- Source of contracts and supplies (Pit Bosses)
- Oppressor and exploiter (others)
- Necessary evil for survival

### With Union
- Source of better food and support
- Alternative to Corporate tyranny
- Another faction trying to control them

### With Each Other
- Competition for resources
- Temporary alliances
- Constant betrayals
- Shared suffering creates some solidarity

## Motivations

### Survival
- Day-to-day focus on not dying
- Get enough food, power, shelter

### Freedom
- Escape both factions' control
- Self-determination
- Build something new

### Profit
- Exploit the chaos
- Sell to both sides
- Accumulate power/resources

### Transcendence (Cults)
- Follow the Whispers
- Achieve transformation
- Understand C-7's purpose

## The Powder Keg Potential

### If United
- 1,800 people = 36% of colony
- 30 MW = second highest power
- Control strategic 2-6km zones
- Could force three-way negotiation

### When Reactor Fails
- Suddenly more powerful than Corporate
- Voltaic Lords become kingmakers
- Both factions bid desperately
- Opportunity for unity or greater chaos

### Requirements for Unity
1. Charismatic unifying leader
2. External crisis forcing cooperation
3. Deal with Whisper cults
4. Overcome economic competition
5. Survive Corporate-Union sabotage

## Why Frontier Matters

They are the future:
- Largest population segment
- Growing while others shrink
- Control key infrastructure
- Most adapted to current reality

They are the wild card:
- Could tip balance either way
- Could forge third path
- Could destroy everything
- Nobody controls them fully

The fractured majority that holds the colony's fate - if they could only stop killing each other long enough to realize it.
