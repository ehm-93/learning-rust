# Corporate Faction

## Overview
**Population**: 1,500 (30% of colony)  
**Territory**: Levels 0-4km  
**Power**: 60 MW (1 dying reactor) + 10 MW backup  
**Leadership**: Board of Directors (9 members)

## History

### Founding Authority
Original colonial administration under the Mining Conglomerate. Held absolute power through control of infrastructure, supplies, and communications with Earth.

### The Board Vote (Year 3)
Received 73 transmissions about Earth's nuclear destruction. Voted 6-3 to suppress the information. The three dissenting members disappeared in Year 4 - the founding atrocity that defines Corporate culture.

### D+13 (Years 13-15)
When the cover-up was exposed, Corporate fought to maintain control. Used siege tactics, sealing entire sectors and starving 3,000 Union members over 6 months. Emerged diminished but still in power.

### The Cold War (Years 55-165)
Maintains control through surveillance, collective punishment, and the threat of "disappearance." References to the board purge ("share her fate") keep the population terrified.

## Ideology
**"Earth will return, we must be ready"**

A cargo cult maintaining operations for a civilization that died 162 years ago. Current leadership knows the truth but maintains the lie their predecessors built on blood.

## Power Structure

### The Board
- 9 members with absolute authority
- Can make anyone disappear without explanation
- Current board knows about the 6-3 vote
- Maintains legitimacy through control of reactor

### Security Forces
- Embedded in all sectors
- 20 officers in University alone
- Conduct purges every decade
- ~200 defectors executed over 110 years

## Resources & Economy

### Power Budget (60 MW)
- C-7 extraction: 45 MW (75% - obsessive priority)
- Life support: 10 MW (bare minimum)
- Security: 5 MW

### Stockpile
- 2 million tons of C-7 for Earth that will never come
- Represents 150 years of extracted suffering
- Monument to denial and sunk cost

## Relationships

### With Union
- Mutual hatred from D+13
- Cold war for 110 years
- Exhaustion prevents direct conflict
- Compete for Frontier loyalty

### With Frontier
- Subsidizes aligned contractors
- Licenses Pit Boss territories
- Uses as proxy forces
- Benefits from Frontier division

### With University
- Controls through Charter
- Embedded security presence
- Regular purges for "Union sympathy"
- Depends on for FTL research

### With Crystalline Faith
- Officially dismisses as "degenerates"
- Secretly fears their C-7 understanding
- No direct interaction

## Motivations

### Surface Level
- Maintain order and operations
- Prepare for Earth's return
- Preserve civilization

### Deep Truth
- Survive at any cost
- Maintain power through fear
- Hide the board purge forever
- Keep the population believing the lie

## Vulnerabilities

### The Dying Reactor
- At 30% capacity
- Could fail tomorrow or last decades
- When it fails: 83% power loss
- Must negotiate or die

### The Lost Transmission
- If found, destroys all legitimacy
- Three board members still unaccounted for
- Evidence might exist in deep tunnels

### Population Decline
- Hemorrhaging defectors
- Low morale from oppression
- C-7 infertility

## Internal Conflicts

### Old Guard vs Realists
- Some genuinely believe Earth will return
- Others know it's a lie but fear alternatives
- Younger generation questions everything

### The Unspoken Truth
- Everyone knows about the board purge
- Nobody talks about it
- Creates culture of paranoid silence

## When the Reactor Fails
Corporate drops to 10 MW while Frontier has 30 MW. Options:
1. Negotiate from weakness
2. Attempt desperate seizure of Voltaic banks
3. Mass purge to reduce power needs
4. Finally admit the truth

The end of 165 years of dominance through controlled information.
