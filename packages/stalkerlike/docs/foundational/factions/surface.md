# The Surface

The Colony sits on the starward side of the terminator - tidally locked, perpetually bathed in dim red light. Ross 154 massive on the horizon only 0.065 AU away. The Old Company spaceport ruins sprawl across kilometers of rust-colored rock - collapsed hangars, gutted maintenance facilities, and corpses in failed pressure suits.

The temperature is almost comfortable - room temp in the shade. But you need a pressure suit to survive.

Ross 154 is a flare star. Hour by hour, its luminosity and radiation emission can spike 10x without warning. Flares last anywhere from a few minutes to days. Maybe an hour between them, maybe weeks. During a flare, unshielded exposure means radiation poisoning, equipment failure, death. The Old Company built extensive rad-shielding into their industrial facilities, but most of it failed decades ago.

There are no factions here. No leaders. No organization worth mentioning. Just people with guns and people without them.

## The Way It Works

Someone controls a pressurized workspace until someone stronger takes it. You own what you can defend. Alliances last as long as they're useful - usually hours, sometimes days, never much longer. 

The Surface was never meant for habitation - only industrial operations. All permanent residences were built underground. When D+13 erupted, desperate people fled topside to escape the violence, crowding into maintenance facilities and cargo bays that were never designed to sustain human life. Most died within days - caught outside when flare periods began, radiation sickness, equipment failure. The rest learned to be ruthless or invisible.

No one is exiled to the Surface anymore. The flares make it too unpredictable - sometimes you have days of calm, sometimes a flare period lasts a week and traps you in whatever shielding you can find. It's just a slower death sentence. But some still flee up here voluntarily, choosing radiation hell over whatever they're running from below.

Violence is casual. A working air recycler or charged fuel cell is worth killing for. So is an intact suit, a weapon, medical supplies, or just because you looked at someone wrong. The only law is what you can enforce yourself.

## Who Survives

**The Ruthless** - They take what they want. They kill without hesitation. When supplies run low, they know which hab to raid and who won't fight back. They form temporary gangs, split up when convenient, and think nothing of shooting former allies over scraps. These are the ones who last longest, who control the few pressurized spaces worth having.

**The Meek** - They hide. They scavenge in places others won't go. They survive by being beneath notice, by offering just enough value to be kept alive as useful slaves or informants. They repair equipment, scout dangerous areas, or provide other services in exchange for not being murdered. Most die anyway.

**The Lucky** - They stumble on a good salvage haul. They find a sealed hab with working life support. They're standing in the right place when someone else gets shot. They survive a week, maybe two, then their luck runs out.

Everyone else is already dead.

## Daily Existence

Life on the Surface is scavenging, stealing, and waiting to die. The flares are the rhythm of existence - you watch the star, you monitor radiation levels, you know when a flare period is beginning because the light intensifies and the dosimeter starts screaming. Then you find shielded cover and wait it out. Half an hour if you're lucky. A week if you're not. Equipment fails constantly from cumulative radiation damage. Suit seals crack, electronics fry, air recyclers clog. Radiation sickness is universal; it's just a question of how fast. Food is whatever you can take from someone weaker or steal from Corporate through the utility tunnels.

The spaceport and industrial facilities offer hundreds of places to hide but were never built for long-term human occupation. Maintenance workshops, cargo loading bays, equipment storage - all temporary workspaces with minimal life support. The rad-shielding in these facilities is patchy at best. Some rooms are safe, others are death traps. You learn which is which by watching who dies.

Most Surface dwellers move constantly, timing their movements during calm periods, seeking shelter when flare periods begin, sleeping in the few shielded spaces they can defend, trusting no one.

## The Tunnel Networks

Dozens, maybe hundreds, of utility tunnels connect the spaceport ruins to the colony below - maintenance shafts, ventilation ducts, old cargo routes. Corporate sealed most of them after D+13, but there are always gaps, always forgotten passages.

These tunnels are how Surface dwellers survive. Raiding Corporate supply lines, stealing from convoys, ambushing lone workers. It's dangerous - Corporate Security patrols regularly and shoots on sight - but it's better than starving.

Some people live in the tunnels full-time, never surfacing, never going deep enough to encounter real patrols. Rat life. Dark, cold, but marginally safer than topside.

## Why Anyone Cares

The Surface should be worthless. A radiation-blasted industrial graveyard with nothing worth the risk.

Except the Old Company left things behind.

Classified facilities. Research labs. Secure storage. Places that were sealed and abandoned during the collapse, their locations never in official records. Corporate and the Unions both believe there's Old Company tech up there - weapons, data, equipment that predates the current power structure. Stuff that could shift the balance below.

So they send teams topside. Quiet operations, off the books. Looking for sealed bunkers, encrypted data cores, prototype weapons. Most teams don't come back - killed by radiation exposure or the Surface dwellers who've learned that Corporate operatives carry good equipment worth stealing.

The Surface dwellers know the rumors too. Every violent thug with a gun thinks they'll stumble on an Old Company cache and buy their way back into civilized life. It never works out. But the hope keeps them searching, fighting, killing each other over maps and coordinates that might lead nowhere.

Meanwhile, the ruins stay dangerous, the flares keep killing, and everyone keeps dying for ghosts of the Old Company.

## Key Personalities

Factions don't matter on the Surface. Individuals do. Whoever controls the working industrial spaces, whoever knows where the Old Company sealed their secrets, whoever has the most guns - those are the people who shape what passes for society up here.

Names change constantly. Someone's in charge until they're dead. Then someone else is. The player will encounter whoever happens to be violent enough to still be breathing when they arrive topside.

No friendships. No loyalty. Just survival and the calculus of who you need alive and who you can afford to kill.

## Game Implications

The Surface is a hostile zone where the player has no allies, only temporary conveniences. Every NPC is a potential threat. Every encounter is tense. Trust no one, because they're absolutely considering whether killing you is worth the ammo.

The flare periods create dynamic threat - you might have days of relative safety before a flare period begins and traps you in shelter for hours or weeks. Learning to read radiation warnings, finding adequate shielding, and managing resources during extended flare periods becomes critical.

The Old Company facilities provide high-risk, high-reward exploration. Sealed bunkers that haven't been opened in over a century. Maybe they contain valuable tech. Maybe something worse is inside.

**Mechanical considerations:**
- Flare star mechanics - unpredictable periods of heightened radiation (30 minutes to a week)
- Calm periods for movement vs. flare periods requiring shelter
- Radiation accumulation and treatment
- Failed shielding in industrial facilities - some rooms safe, others lethal
- Resource management during extended flare periods
- NPC hostility and unpredictable self-interested behavior
- Old Company facility exploration and loot
- Scarcity creating constant resource tension
- Utility tunnels as infiltration routes between Surface and colony
