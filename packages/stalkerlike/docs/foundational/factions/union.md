# Union Faction

## Overview
**Population**: 1,200 (24% of colony)  
**Territory**: Levels 4-6km  
**Power**: 20 MW (2 voltaic banks, stable)  
**Structure**: Three ideological subfactions requiring 2/3 majority

## History

### Formation
Born from labor organizing against Corporate exploitation. Originally unified by shared oppression and desire for worker control.

### D+13 (Years 13-15)
Suffered catastrophic losses when Corporate sealed sectors. 3,000 Union members starved over 6 months. Emerged traumatized but determined.

### The Voltaic Strike (Year 47)
Voted 62% to sabotage Voltaic Bank 3. Oversized charges caused radiation breach, killing 1,200. The moral wound that split the Union forever.

### The Cold War (Years 55-165)
Maintains stalemate through exhaustion and overextension. Controls critical infrastructure that prevents Corporate from attacking directly.

## Three Subfactions

### Labor Reform (16% - Social Democrats)
**History**: Reluctantly voted YES on Voltaic Strike, consumed by guilt  
**Ideology**: Gradual reform, preserve Earth culture, document all crimes  
**Secret**: Know true death toll was 1,200, not 740  
**Role**: Swing vote between other factions

### Vanguard (54% - Leninists)
**History**: Advocated for Voltaic Strike, no regrets  
**Ideology**: Strategic patience, wait for reactor failure  
**Leadership**: Run Union by default majority  
**Goal**: Negotiate from strength when Corporate weakens

### Collective (30% - Anarcho-Pacifists)
**History**: Voted NO on Strike, vindicated by deaths  
**Ideology**: Direct democracy, mutual aid, absolute pacifism  
**Conflict**: Irreconcilable with Vanguard  
**Vision**: Horizontal organization without hierarchy

## Power Structure

### Voting System
- Major decisions require 2/3 majority
- Vanguard needs either Labor Reform OR Collective
- Creates enforced compromise
- Prevents another Voltaic Strike

## Resources & Economy

### Superior Efficiency
- 20 MW serves 1,200 people well
- Better living conditions than Corporate with 1/3 the power
- Technical expertise from skilled workers
- Mutual aid networks reduce waste

### Black Market
- Trades food and technical support
- Exchanges with Frontier sympathizers
- Smuggles to Corporate defectors
- Economic warfare tool

## Relationships

### With Corporate
- Deep mutual hatred from D+13
- 3,000 Union members starved
- Cold war for 110 years
- Wait for reactor failure to shift balance

### With Frontier
- Offers better deals to sympathizers
- Provides superior food and expertise
- Competes for Voltaic Lords' loyalty
- Benefits from keeping Frontier divided

### With University
- Secret sympathizers among academics
- Occasional intelligence sharing
- Cannot openly support due to Corporate surveillance

### With Crystalline Faith
- Views as tragic victims of Corporate system
- No formal contact
- Some philosophical sympathy from Collective

## Motivations

### Surface Unity
- Worker control of production
- End Corporate oppression
- Just distribution of resources

### Subfaction Goals

**Labor Reform**

- Prevent more violence

**Vanguard**
- Seize control when reactor fails
- Disciplined revolutionary patience
- No compromise with Corporate

**Collective**

## Internal Conflicts

### The Strike Divide
- Labor Reform's guilt vs Vanguard's conviction
- Collective's "told you so" bitterness
- Can't discuss without reopening wounds

### Strategy Disagreement
- Vanguard: Wait and prepare
- Labor Reform: Seek dialogue
- Collective: Build alternatives now

### The 2/3 Problem
- No faction can act alone
- Forced compromise frustrates all
- Sometimes paralyzed by disagreement

## Vulnerabilities

### Factional Paralysis
- 2/3 requirement prevents quick decisions
- Internal debates leak to Corporate
- Energy spent on internal conflict

### Limited Territory
- Only 2km of depth (4-6km)
- Surrounded above and below
- Expansion blocked

### Demographic Decline
- Aging population
- C-7 infertility
- Young people flee to Frontier

## Strengths

### Infrastructure Control
- Water and air are ultimate leverage
- Cannot be destroyed without colony death
- Technical expertise irreplaceable

### Moral Authority
- Survived Corporate's siege
- Better living conditions prove their model
- Attract defectors and sympathizers

### Stability
- 20 MW power supply secure
- No reliance on failing reactor
- Can outlast Corporate

## When the Reactor Fails

Union suddenly holds cards:
1. Vanguard pushes for total victory
2. Labor Reform seeks grand reconciliation
3. Collective wants to dissolve both systems
4. Frontier becomes kingmaker

The moment they've waited 110 years for - if they don't tear themselves apart first.
