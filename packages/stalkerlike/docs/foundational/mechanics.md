# Ross 154a - Core Game Mechanics

## Stalker-Like Foundation

### Core Philosophy
- **Nobody Special**: You're one worker among 5,000 in a dying colony
- **Persistent World**: Colony continues without you - conflicts escalate, systems degrade
- **Exploration-Driven**: Venture into abandoned zones for resources and secrets
- **Survival Pressure**: Energy and life support create constant tension

### The Zone Structure
- **Safe Settlements**: Populated areas with atmosphere and power
- **Abandoned Sections**: Dangerous zones requiring full life support
- **Emergent Objectives**: Discover opportunities while exploring
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Piece together colony history through exploration

### The Stalker Loop
1. **Prepare**: Plan energy budget, gather equipment, choose objectives
2. **Explore**: Venture into abandoned zones with limited life support
3. **Survive**: Manage resources while avoiding hazards and hostiles
4. **Return**: Bring back salvage to trade and upgrade equipment
5. **Progress**: Use profits to access deeper, more dangerous zones

## Survival Systems

### Energy Economy
- **Power Generation**: Generators provide continuous power for life support
- **Battery Storage**: Finite energy reserves limit expedition duration
- **Power Budget**: Balance life support, equipment, and emergency reserves
- **Equipment Drain**: Weapons, scanners, and tools consume power
- **Social Currency**: Charged batteries and power cells are valuable trade goods

### Life Support Zones
- **Safe Settlements**: Atmosphere, heat, and power - no suit required
- **Abandoned Sections**: No life support - personal systems mandatory
- **Suit Systems**: Oxygen, heating, and pressure regulation
- **Duration Limits**: Life support capacity constrains exploration time
- **Failure Consequences**: Equipment damage causes leaks and power drain

### Environmental Hazards
- **Temperature Gradient**: Surface comfortable (0-20°C), deep zones dangerously hot (~80°C at 10km, ~140°C at 20km from residual primordial heat)
- **Oxygen Depletion**: Suit air recycling systems fail over time  
- **Pressure Changes**: Rapid depth changes cause injury
- **Equipment Failure**: Heat stresses damage electronics in deep zones

### The C-7 Horror
- **Exposure Accumulation**: C-7 builds up in your system over time
- **Gradual Effects**: Whispers → mutations → transformation (if untreated)
- **Treatment Options**: Medical facilities can reduce exposure, but it's expensive and time-consuming
- **Risk vs Reward**: Deeper zones have more C-7 but better salvage
- **The Whispers**: Provide intel but erode sanity while exposure is high
- **Recovery Time**: Natural detox is slow, medical treatment is faster but costly

## The Colony

### Zone Structure
- **10-15 Active Settlements**: 50-400 NPCs each, connected by transport tunnels
- **Abandoned Infrastructure**: 90% of colony empty - built for 50,000, now holds 5,000
- **Major Arterials**: Fast travel between zones, controlled by factions
- **Service Networks**: Slow, hidden routes for smuggling and exploration
- **Thermal Layers**: Surface habitable (0-20°C), deep zones increasingly hot (~80°C at 10km, ~140°C at 20km)

### Factions and Politics
- **Corporate**: Former Old Company executives, control the main settlement
- **Union**: Worker collectives in industrial zones
- **Frontier**: Independent scavengers and traders in outer settlements
- **Reputation System**: Actions affect standing with all factions
- **Cold War**: Factions compete through proxies and economic warfare

### Environmental Storytelling
- **Massive Scale**: Infrastructure built for 10x current population
- **Sealed Sections**: Blast doors mark areas abandoned during the D+13 crisis
- **Ghost Infrastructure**: Oversized systems and empty corridors tell the story
- **Visible Inaccessibility**: Glimpse sealed areas through windows and grating

## Core Systems

### Information Economy
- **Intel as Currency**: Sell secrets between factions
- **Eavesdropping**: Position-based listening for valuable information
- **Reputation Tracking**: Every NPC remembers your actions
- **Relationship Building**: Long-term bonds more valuable than quick trades

### Equipment and Progression
- **Salvage-Based**: Find and repair Old Company technology
- **Faction Styles**: Different engineering approaches and aesthetics
- **Equipment Degradation**: Everything breaks down over time
- **Power Requirements**: Better gear needs more energy to function

## Death and Legacy

### Death Modes
**Permadeath Mode (Hardcore)**:
- **Game Over**: Character death deletes the save file permanently
- **Ultimate Stakes**: Every decision matters, no second chances
- **Pure Tension**: Maximum fear and careful planning required

**Standard Mode**:
- **Respawn at Last Rest**: Return to last settlement or safe zone visited
- **Drop All Equipment**: Lose all gear at death location
- **Body Recovery**: Return to retrieve dropped items if you can survive the trip back
- **Reputation Retained**: Keep faction relationships and quest progress
- **Equipment Risk**: Valuable gear creates meaningful loss without ending the game

### The Inevitable End
- **Colony Doomed**: Can delay but not prevent collapse (both modes)
- **Personal Agency**: Choose how you face the inevitable
- **Legacy Through Actions**: How your choices shape the colony's final days
- **Multiple Paths**: Different ways to witness the end

## Design Principles

### Stalker-Like Core
- **Survival Horror**: Constant resource pressure and environmental threats
- **Exploration Reward**: Best loot in most dangerous places
- **Emergent Narrative**: Stories emerge from systematic interaction
- **Atmospheric Immersion**: Environmental storytelling and audio design
- **Player Agency**: Meaningful choices within systemic constraints

The game creates the classic stalker experience: prepare carefully, venture into hostile territory, survive against the odds, and return with valuable salvage - all while uncovering the mysteries of a doomed world through exploration and interaction.
