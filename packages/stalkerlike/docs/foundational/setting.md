# Ross 154a - Setting Overview

## The Ross 154 System
**Ross 154**: Red dwarf star, 9.7 light-years from Sol. Mass: 0.17 solar masses, Luminosity: 0.38% of Sol's output. A young, volatile flare star prone to dangerous stellar storms.

**Ross 154a**: The colony world - a stripped iron-rich planetary core orbiting at 0.065 AU. Mass: 0.85 Earth masses, Gravity: 0.8g surface gravity. Tidally locked to the red dwarf with one face in eternal day, the other in eternal night.

**Ross 154b**: Neptune-class ice giant at 2-3 AU. Its gravitational influence during system formation disrupted Ross 154a's accretion, stripping away the lighter elements and leaving behind the metal-rich core that made deep mining economically viable.

## The Hostile World
**Surface Conditions**: Lethal radiation environment due to stellar flares and weak magnetic field (~2-5 μT, 10% of Earth's strength). The planet's slow rotation (tidally locked ~10-20 day period) creates insufficient magnetic dynamo protection against the young flare star's particle bombardment.

**Geological Activity**: Continuous tidal heating from the close stellar orbit keeps the iron core molten and drives ongoing crustal stress. Seismic activity, thermal vents, and structural instability make deep mining operations inherently dangerous - a constant battle against an active, flexing world.

**Underground Necessity**: The colony exists entirely underground in the terminator band where rock shielding protects from radiation and temperatures remain habitable (0-20°C surface, rising to 150°C+ at 10km depth from tidal heating).

## The Colony
A dying mining colony built for 50,000 but now holding 5,000 survivors. The colony extends 10km deep through increasingly dangerous thermal and seismic zones, exploiting the planet's iron-rich composition while battling both the inexorable heat from tidal forces and the structural failures that come with active geology.

## The Isolation
Year 165 since Earth went silent. Nuclear war destroyed humanity's homeworld in Year 3. The corporate board suppressed this truth, leading to 35,000 deaths during "D+13" when the cover-up was exposed. Now the colony slowly dies from infertility, transformation, and attrition.

## Catalyst-7
The exotic matter that enabled FTL travel now poisons the colony. It bonds permanently to living tissue through quantum entanglement, creating addiction that can't be broken. 

**Exposure Effects:**
- ~30% become Sensitives who hear the Whispers
- ~5% die immediately
- ~4% transform into the Touched
- ~1% vanish without trace at Dissolution Sites

## The Factions
Five major groups locked in a 110-year cold civil war:

- **Corporate** (1,500): Authoritarian control, dying reactor, maintains the lie
- **Union** (1,200): Three ideological subfactions in uneasy alliance
- **Frontier** (1,800): Fractured majority, proxy war battleground
- **Crystalline Faith** (200): Death cult seeking transcendence through C-7
- **University** (300): Trapped intellectuals seeking impossible FTL escape

## The Horror
Multiple layers of existential dread:

1. **The Whispers**: Sensitives hear voices with ~60% accuracy. Communication? Psychosis? Nobody knows.
2. **The Touched**: Transformed humans that violate thermodynamics, sustained by C-7 alone
3. **Dissolution Sites**: Where consciousness might be absorbed into C-7 formations
4. **The Lost Transmission**: Evidence of Earth's death hidden for 161 years
5. **The Dying Infrastructure**: One reactor at 30% capacity, could fail any moment
6. **The Living Planet**: Continuous seismic activity and thermal vents remind everyone that the world itself is hostile - crushing tunnels, flooding chambers with superheated gas, and slowly cooking the deepest levels as tidal forces never cease

## The Powder Keg
When the reactor fails, Corporate loses power and Frontier suddenly holds the balance. But Whisper cults create chaos, preventing unity. The colony stands at a breaking point after 165 years of slow collapse.

## Core Themes
- Truth vs comfortable lies
- Collective trauma and how societies fracture
- The horror of ambiguity - is C-7 conscious or just toxic?
- Power through controlled information
- Survival at any cost vs maintaining humanity
