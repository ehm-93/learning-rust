# Ross 154a - Setting Overview

## The Ross 154 System
**Ross 154**: Red dwarf star, 9.7 light-years from Sol. Mass: 0.17 solar masses, Luminosity: 0.38% of Sol's output. A volatile flare star prone to dangerous stellar storms.

**Ross 154a**: The colony world - a stripped iron-rich planetary core orbiting at 0.065 AU. Mass: 0.85 Earth masses, Gravity: 0.8g surface gravity. Age: 2-3 billion years. Tidally locked to the red dwarf in a circular orbit, with one face in eternal day, the other in eternal night.

**Ross 154b**: Neptune-class ice giant at 2-3 AU. Its gravitational influence during system formation disrupted Ross 154a's accretion, stripping away the lighter elements and leaving behind the metal-rich core that made deep mining economically viable.

## The Hostile World
**Surface Conditions**: Lethal radiation environment due to stellar flares and weak remanent magnetic field (~2-5 μT, 10% of Earth's strength). The solid core cannot generate an active dynamo, leaving insufficient shielding against the flare star's particle bombardment.

**Geological Status**: Geologically dead world. The circular orbit provides no tidal flexing, and the planet has long since cooled from its violent formation. Seismic activity is rare - limited to occasional thermal contraction events as residual heat slowly escapes. The deep mines are stable but uncomfortably warm.

**Underground Necessity**: The colony exists entirely underground in the terminator band where rock shielding protects from radiation and temperatures remain habitable (0-20°C surface, rising to ~80°C at 10km depth and ~140°C at 20km depth from residual primordial heat and minimal radiogenic decay with a gradient of 6-8°C/km).

## The Colony
A dying mining colony built for 50,000 but now holding 5,000 survivors. The colony extends 10-20km deep through increasingly hot zones, exploiting the planet's iron-rich composition while managing the rising temperatures from residual primordial heat.

## The Isolation
Year 165 since Earth went silent. Nuclear war destroyed humanity's homeworld in Year 3. The corporate board suppressed this truth, leading to 35,000 deaths during "D+13" when the cover-up was exposed. Now the colony slowly dies from infertility, transformation, and attrition.

## Catalyst-7
The exotic matter that enabled FTL travel now poisons the colony. It bonds permanently to living tissue through quantum entanglement, creating addiction that can't be broken. 

**Exposure Effects:**
- ~30% become Sensitives who hear the Whispers
- ~5% die immediately
- ~4% transform into the Touched
- ~1% vanish without trace at Dissolution Sites

## The Factions
Five major groups locked in a 110-year cold civil war:

- **Corporate** (1,500): Authoritarian control, dying reactor, maintains the lie
- **Union** (1,200): Three ideological subfactions in uneasy alliance
- **Frontier** (1,800): Fractured majority, proxy war battleground
- **Crystalline Faith** (200): Death cult seeking transcendence through C-7
- **University** (300): Trapped intellectuals seeking impossible FTL escape

## The Horror
Multiple layers of existential dread:

1. **The Whispers**: Sensitives hear voices with ~60% accuracy. Communication? Psychosis? Nobody knows.
2. **The Touched**: Transformed humans that violate thermodynamics, sustained by C-7 alone
3. **Dissolution Sites**: Where consciousness might be absorbed into C-7 formations
4. **The Lost Transmission**: Evidence of Earth's death hidden for 161 years
5. **The Dying Infrastructure**: One reactor at 30% capacity, could fail any moment
6. **The Deep Heat**: Residual planetary warmth makes the deepest mines uncomfortably hot but structurally stable - a slow, patient threat rather than violent geological chaos

## The Powder Keg
When the reactor fails, Corporate loses power and Frontier suddenly holds the balance. But Whisper cults create chaos, preventing unity. The colony stands at a breaking point after 165 years of slow collapse.

## Core Themes
- Truth vs comfortable lies
- Collective trauma and how societies fracture
- The horror of ambiguity - is C-7 conscious or just toxic?
- Power through controlled information
- Survival at any cost vs maintaining humanity
