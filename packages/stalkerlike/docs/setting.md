# Ross 154a - Setting Overview

## The Colony
A dying mining colony 9.7 light-years from Earth, built for 50,000 but now holding 5,000 survivors. Located on a tidally locked planet with the red dwarf frozen on the horizon. The colony exists underground in the terminator band between eternal day and night.

## The Isolation
Year 165 since Earth went silent. Nuclear war destroyed humanity's homeworld in Year 3. The corporate board suppressed this truth, leading to 35,000 deaths during "D+13" when the cover-up was exposed. Now the colony slowly dies from infertility, transformation, and attrition.

## Catalyst-7
The exotic matter that enabled FTL travel now poisons the colony. It bonds permanently to living tissue through quantum entanglement, creating addiction that can't be broken. 

**Exposure Effects:**
- ~30% become Sensitives who hear the Whispers
- ~5% die immediately
- ~4% transform into the Touched
- ~1% vanish without trace at Dissolution Sites

## The Factions
Five major groups locked in a 110-year cold civil war:

- **Corporate** (1,500): Authoritarian control, dying reactor, maintains the lie
- **Union** (1,200): Three ideological subfactions in uneasy alliance
- **Frontier** (1,800): Fractured majority, proxy war battleground
- **Crystalline Faith** (200): Death cult seeking transcendence through C-7
- **University** (300): Trapped intellectuals seeking impossible FTL escape

## The Horror
Multiple layers of existential dread:

1. **The Whispers**: Sensitives hear voices with ~60% accuracy. Communication? Psychosis? Nobody knows.
2. **The Touched**: Transformed humans that violate thermodynamics, sustained by C-7 alone
3. **Dissolution Sites**: Where consciousness might be absorbed into C-7 formations
4. **The Lost Transmission**: Evidence of Earth's death hidden for 161 years
5. **The Dying Infrastructure**: One reactor at 30% capacity, could fail any moment

## The Powder Keg
When the reactor fails, Corporate loses power and Frontier suddenly holds the balance. But Whisper cults create chaos, preventing unity. The colony stands at a breaking point after 165 years of slow collapse.

## Core Themes
- Truth vs comfortable lies
- Collective trauma and how societies fracture
- The horror of ambiguity - is C-7 conscious or just toxic?
- Power through controlled information
- Survival at any cost vs maintaining humanity
