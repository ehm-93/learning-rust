# The Banker - Concept Brief

## The Core

**Rescued from deep hell.** Once found, appears in sanctuaries.

**Banks currency items only.** Essences, orbs, crafting materials. Limited capacity.

---

## The Problem It Solves

**Endgame time investment becomes prohibitive.**

Level 80 takes hours to reach. Die = total loss = players quit.

Not because they're weak. Because their time was erased.

---

## What It Enables

**Ambitious deep runs without existential dread.**

Bank your essences at level 60. Push to 90. Die horribly.

Lose your gear. Lose your void stacks. Lose the run.

But keep some progression. Your time wasn't voided.

---

## The Tension

**Deposit frequency matters.** Bank too often = zero-risk grinding. Bank too rarely = Banker is pointless.

**Limited capacity.** Can't bank everything. Still choosing what to risk.

**Currency vs. gear.** Equipment still dies with you. The legendary weapon is never safe.

**Rescue depth.** Must be deep enough that finding the Banker is an achievement. Too shallow = trivializes mid-game.

---

## The Risk

**Enables grind optimization.** Dive 10 levels, bank, repeat forever. The feedback loop you're trying to avoid.

**Removes currency fear.** If crafting materials are safe, does death lose half its teeth?

**Meta calcification.** "Always bank at sanctuaries" becomes doctrine. Strategy space collapses.

---

## Why It Might Work

**Softens endgame without removing stakes.** Gear loss still hurts. Void loss still hurts. But not "delete 3 hours" hurt.

**Rewards deep exploration.** Finding the Banker requires risk. Using the Banker enables more risk.

**Tactical layer.** What to bank? When? How much capacity to use?

---

## Why It Might Not

**Safety nets reduce drama.** Every cushion weakens "risk everything."

**Could be solving the wrong problem.** Maybe level 80 shouldn't take 3 hours. Maybe harsh loss is correct design.

**Might be premature.** Does endgame need this, or does it need something else?

---

## Status

**Uncommitted.** Valid concept. Real risks. Wait for playtesting to reveal whether endgame death is intolerable or essential.

---

*"Your shards are safe. Your ambition, however..."*
