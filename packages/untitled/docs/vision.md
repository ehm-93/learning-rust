# Deep Dive - Game Design Document

## Vision Statement
A twin-stick roguelike that masquerades as a simple dungeon crawler but reveals infinite depth to those who dare look beneath the surface. Every system is designed around the central tension: **how deep will you go, and what will you sacrifice to return?**

## Core Philosophy
- **Discovery over instruction** - The game teaches through exploration, not tutorials
- **Depth through layers** - Simple mechanics combine into complex emergent systems  
- **Meaningful choice under pressure** - Every decision has weight and consequence
- **Community-driven revelation** - Hidden mechanics spread through player sharing

---

## The Extraction Paradigm

**The Central Loop:**
Dive → Explore → Collect → **Extract or Perish**

**The Core Tension:**
Every step deeper increases both reward and risk. The game constantly asks: *"Is what you've found worth what you might lose?"*

**Victory Redefined:**
Success isn't reaching the end - it's getting back out with something valuable. The surface becomes the true destination.

## World Structure

### Three Primary Scenes
- **The Cathedral** - The starting sanctuary and hub of preparation
- **The Dungeon (Hell)** - The infinite descent of increasingly dangerous levels
- **Sanctuaries** - Safe havens between dungeon levels with extraction opportunities

### Sanctuary Hierarchy
**Greater Sanctuaries** (every 10th level):
- Full inventory extraction capability
- Three additional loot chests for enhanced rewards
- Major preparation and planning opportunities
- Strategic waypoints for deep expeditions

**Lesser Sanctuaries** (all other levels):
- Partial extraction - equipped items plus limited inventory
- Single loot chest for modest rewards
- Brief respite and basic preparation
- Critical decision points for continued descent

### The Extraction Tension
Sanctuaries create natural **risk evaluation moments** where players must choose: cash out with current gains, or push deeper for greater rewards. The 10-level rhythm builds anticipation and creates strategic planning opportunities.

### Level Modification System  
Players can alter upcoming challenges using rare modifier artifacts. This transforms passive difficulty scaling into **active risk negotiation** - you choose how much danger to face.

---

## Progression Philosophy

### The Deception of Victory
The game presents an achievable goal (extract from the first Greater Sanctuary at Level 10) that satisfies most players. Only after this "victory" do players discover the true depth - Level 10 was merely the **introduction** to the infinite descent waiting below. Each subsequent Greater Sanctuary (20, 30, 40...) reveals new layers of complexity and challenge.

### Discovery-Driven Narrative
NPCs aren't found in safe taverns - they're **rescued from the depths**. Every quest comes from your own exploration, making story feel earned rather than assigned.

### Layered Complexity
- **Surface layer:** Twin-stick combat and basic extraction
- **Hidden layer:** Spell crafting, environmental manipulation, secret mechanics
- **Meta layer:** Community knowledge, optimal strategies, true completion

---

## Risk & Reward Architecture

### Extraction Economics
- **Greater Sanctuary extraction** - Full inventory retained, bonus loot from 3 chests
- **Lesser Sanctuary extraction** - Equipped gear + limited inventory, 1 bonus chest
- **Emergency extraction** - Escape immediate danger, abandon most loot  
- **No extraction** - Lose everything, but knowledge remains

### The Sanctuary Gamble
Each sanctuary presents a calculated risk: extract now with guaranteed gains, or push toward the next sanctuary (potentially greater) for exponentially better rewards. The 10-level greater sanctuary rhythm creates **psychological waypoints** that structure the infinite descent into manageable risk chunks.

### The Inventory Dilemma
Limited carrying capacity forces constant evaluation: *"Is this new item worth dropping something I already have?"* Combined with extraction limits, every piece of loot becomes a **commitment**.

### Compound Risk
- Deeper levels offer exponentially better rewards
- But also exponentially higher stakes
- Safe zones become unreachable
- Emergency extraction becomes more expensive
- Death becomes more punishing

## Mechanical Motifs

### Environmental Storytelling
The world itself tells the story through:
- **Destructible terrain** that remembers past battles
- **Persistent changes** that survive across runs
- **Archaeological layers** revealing the world's history
- **Mystery through absence** - what happened here?

### Player Agency in Challenge
Rather than imposing difficulty, the game offers **tools for self-imposed challenge**:
- Modifier systems for level customization  
- Multiple risk/reward extraction paths
- Optional objectives with scaling rewards
- Player-driven discovery of optimal strategies

### Emergent Complexity
Simple systems interact to create sophisticated gameplay:
- Basic shooting + destructible terrain = tactical demolition
- Loot scarcity + extraction limits = inventory economics  
- NPC rescue + quest systems = discovery-driven progression
- Level modifiers + targeted farming = strategic planning

---

## Community & Discovery

### Organic Knowledge Sharing
- No comprehensive tutorials for advanced systems
- Players naturally share discoveries and strategies
- Wiki becomes essential community resource
- "Did you know you can..." moments drive engagement

### Hidden Depth Philosophy
The game never fully reveals itself. There are always:
- **Undiscovered mechanics** waiting to be found
- **Optimal strategies** still being developed  
- **Secret content** gated behind community collaboration
- **Theoretical limits** yet to be reached

---

## Design Principles

### Respect Player Intelligence
- Trust players to figure things out
- Reward experimentation and creativity
- Don't explain what can be discovered
- Let mastery feel earned, not given

### Every System Serves the Core
All mechanics support the extraction tension:
- Combat creates risk that threatens extraction
- Loot creates weight that complicates extraction  
- NPCs create goals that justify extraction risks
- Modifiers let players tune extraction difficulty

### Failure as Progress
- Death teaches valuable lessons
- Failed runs reveal new information
- Community shares failure stories as learning tools
- Mastery emerges from accumulated failure

---

## Success Metrics

### Surface Engagement
- Players reaching first Greater Sanctuary extraction (Level 10)
- Ratio of Greater vs Lesser Sanctuary extractions
- Average extraction depth over time
- Repeat play after initial "completion"
- Sanctuary progression patterns and player behavior

### Deep Engagement  
- Community discovery rate of hidden mechanics
- Wiki contribution and complexity growth
- Advanced strategy development and sharing
- Player-driven challenge creation

### Cultural Impact
- "Water cooler" discussion of discoveries
- Social media sharing of unexpected moments
- Community events and challenges
- Influence on other game designs

*"The surface victory is just permission to begin."*
